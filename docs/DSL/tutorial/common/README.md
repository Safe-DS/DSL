# Common Parts of Workflow Language and Stub Language

Several parts of the Simple-ML DSL are shared between the [workflow lanugage][workflow-language] and the [stub language][stub-language]. Here is the list:

* [Packages][packages] help avoid conflicts that could arise if two declarations have the same name.
* [Imports][imports] make declarations in other packages accessible.
* [Parameters][parameters] define the expected inputs of some declaration that can be [called][calls].
* [Results][results] define the outputs of some declaration when it is [called][calls].
* [Types][types] describe the values that a declaration can accept.
* [Comments][comments] document the code.
