# Types

Types describe the values that a declaration can accept. Simple-ML has various categories of types, which are explained in this document.

## Categories of Types

### Named Types

_Named types_ either denote that a declaration must be an instance of a [class][classes] or one of its [subclasses][subclassing], or an instance of a [variant][variants] of an [enum][enums]. In either case the syntax of the type is just the name of the [class][classes] or the [enum][enums] respectively.

#### Class Types

A declaration with a _class type_ must be an instance of a [class][classes] or one of its [subclasses][subclassing]. Let us use the following [classes][classes] for our example:

```
class SomeClass

class SomeSubclass sub SomeClass
```

To denote that a declaration accepts instances of `SomeClass` and its [subclass][subclassing] `SomeSubclass`, we write the name of the class as the type:

```
SomeClass
```

##### Nullable Class Types

The value `null` (see [null][null-literal]) deserves special treatment since it is not possible to operate on it in the same manner as on proper instances of a [class][classes]. For this reason `null` cannot be assigned to declarations with class types such as `SomeClass`.

To specifically allow `null` as a value, simply add a question mark to the named type:

```
SomeClass?
```

#### Enum Types

A declaration with an _enum type_ must be one of the [variants][variants] of the [enum][enums]. Let us use the following [enum][enums] for our example:

```
enum SomeEnum {
    SomeEnumVariant,
    SomeOtherEnumVariant(count: Int)
}
```

To denote that a declaration accepts instances of any [variant][variants] of `SomeEnum`, use the name of the enum as the type:

```
SomeEnum
```

This type expects either the value `SomeEnum.SomeEnumVariant` (see [member access][member-accesses]) or anything constructed from the [variant][variants] `SomeOtherEnumVariant` such as `SomeEnum.SomeOtherEnumVariant(3)`.

#### Type Arguments

**Note:** This is an advanced section. Feel free to skip it initially.

If a declaration has [type parameters][type-parameters] we need to assign all of them when we use the declaration as a named type. This assignment happens in the form of _type arguments_. We explain this using the following declaration:

```
class SomeSpecialList<T>
```

When we use this [class][classes] as a named type, we need to specify the value for the [type parameter][type-parameters] `T`, which is supposed to denote the type of the elements in the list.Similar to [calls][calls], we can either use _positional type arguments_ or _named type arguments_.

In the case of positional type arguments, they are mapped to [type parameters][type-parameters] by position, i.e. the first type argument is assigned to the first [type parameter][type-parameters], the second type argument is assigned to the second [type parameter][type-parameters] and so forth.

If a positional type argument is used, we just write down its value. The value is either
* a [type projection](#type-projection), or
* a [star projection](#star-projection).

For example, if we expect a list of integers, we could use the following type:

```
SomeSpecialList<Int>
```

Let us break down the syntax:
* The usual named type (here `SomeSpecialList`).
* Opening angle bracket.
* A positional type argument (here `Int`).
* A closing angle bracket.

When a named type argument is used, we explicitly specify the [type parameter][type-parameters] that we want to assign. This allows us to specify them in any order. It can also improve the clarity of the code since the meaning of the type argument becomes more apparent. Here is the type for our list of integers when a named argument is used:

```
SomeSpecialList<T = Int>
```

These are the syntactic elements:
* The usual named type (here `SomeSpecialList`).
* Opening angle bracket.
* A named type argument (here `T = Int`). This in turn consists of
  * The name of the [type parameter][type-parameters] (here `T`)
  * An equals sign.
  * The value of the type argument, which is still either a [type projection](#type-projection), or a [star projection](#star-projection).
* A closing angle bracket.

Within a list of type arguments both positional and named type arguments can be used. However, after the first named type arguments all type arguments must be named.

Let us finally look at how multiple type arguments are passed. For this we use the following declaration:

```
class SomeSpecialMap<K, V>
```

This [class][classes] has to [type parameters][type-parameters], namely `K` and `V`, which must both be set if we use this [class][classes] as a named type.

Here is a valid use:

```
SomeSpecialMap<String, V = Int>
```

We will again go over the syntax:

* The usual named type (here `SomeSpecialMap`).
* An opening angle bracket.
* The list of type arguments. Each element is either a positional or a named type argument (see above). Individual elements are separated by commas. A trailing comma is allowed
* A closing angle bracket.

We will now look at the values that we can pass within type arguments.

##### Type Projection

The most basic case is that we pass a concrete type as the value. We have already seen this in the example above where we constructed the type for a list of integers:

```
SomeSpecialList<Int>
```

The value of the type argument is just another named type (here `Int`).

###### Use-Site Variance

It is also possible to set the [variance][variance] of a [type parameter][type-parameters] at the use-site, i.e. where we use the containing declaration as a named type. This is only possible, however, if we did not [specify the variance at the declaration-site][declaration-site-variance].

Covariance is denoted by the keyword `out`. If the variance of a [type parameter][type-parameters] is set to `out`, we can only access methods of the class that only use the [type parameter][type-parameters] in the out-position, i.e. as [results][results]. Methods that use the [type parameter][type-parameters] in the in-position, i.e. as [parameters][parameters] are hidden. Here is an example for the syntax:

```
SomeSpecialList<out Int>
```

The key element here is the keyword `out` that is added to the type argument. This essentially creates a list of integers that can be read from but that cannot be written to.

Contravariance is denoted by the keyword `in`. If the variance of a [type parameter][type-parameters] is set to `in`, we can only access methods of the class that only use the [type parameter][type-parameters] in the in-position, i.e. as [parameters][parameters]. Methods that use the [type parameter][type-parameters] in the out-position, i.e. as [results][results] are hidden. Here is an example of the syntax:

```
SomeSpecialList<in Int>
```

The key element here is the keyword `in` that is added to the type argument. Here we essentially create a list of integers that can be written to but not read from.

##### Star Projection

If we do not want to specify a value for a [type parameter][type-parameters] and just accept everything, we can use a _star projection_. Here is the syntax:

```
SomeSpecialList<*>
```

It consists only of the `*`, which we use as the value of the type argument.

The star projection is usually equivalent to the type projections
* `out Any?` (`Any?` is the supertype of everything), or
* `in Nothing` (`Nothing` is the subtype of everything).

If the [type parameter][type-parameters] has [bounds][type-parameter-bounds], however, the star projection denotes that any type within the [bounds][type-parameter-bounds] is acceptable.

### Member Types

A member type is essentially the same as a [named type](#named-types) with the difference that the declaration we refer to is nested inside [classes][classes] or [enums][enums].

#### Class Member Types

We begin with nested classes and use these declarations to illustrate the concept:

```
class SomeOuterClass {
    class SomeInnerClass
}
```

To specify that a declaration accepts instances of `SomeInnerClass` or its [subclasses][subclassing], use the following member type:

```
SomeOuterClass.SomeInnerClass
```

This has the following syntactic elements:
* Name of the outer [class][classes] (here `SomeOuterClass`).
* A dot.
* Name of the inner [class][classes] (here `SomeInnerClass`).

Classes can be nested multiple levels deep. In this case, use a member access for each level. Let us use the following declarations to explain this:

```
class SomeOuterClass {
    class SomeMiddleClass {
        class SomeInnerClass
    }
}
```

To specify that a declaration accepts instances of `SomeInnerClass`, or its [subclasses][subclassing], use the following member type:

```
SomeOuterClass.SomeMiddleClass.SomeInnerClass
```

If any referenced class has [type parameters][type-parameters] these must be specified by [type arguments](#type-arguments). For this we use these declarations:

```
class SomeOuterClass<A> {
    class SomeInnerClass<B>
}
```

To specify that a declaration accepts instances of `SomeInnerClass` where all type parameters are set to `Int`, or its [subclasses][subclassing], use the following member type:

```
SomeOuterClass<Int>.SomeInnerClass<Int>
```

Finally, as with [named types](#named-types), `null` is not an allowed value by default. To allow it, add a question mark at the end of the member type. This can be used independently from [type arguments](#type-arguments):

```
SomeOuterClass<Int>.SomeInnerClass<Int>?
```

#### Enum Variant Types

Member types are also used to specify that a declaration is an instance of a single [variant][variants] of an [enum][enums]. For this, we use the following declarations:

```
enum SomeEnum {
    SomeEnumVariant(count: Int),
    SomeOtherEnumVariant
}
```

To allow only instances of the [variant][variants] `SomeEnumVariant`, use the following member type:

```
SomeEnum.SomeEnumVariant
```

Let us take apart the syntax:
* The name of the [enum][enums] (here `SomeEnum`).
* A dot.
* The name of the [enum variant][variants] (here `SomeEnumVariant`).

Identical to [class member types](#class-member-types), all [type parameters][type-parameters] of the [enum variant][variants] must be assigned by [type arguments](#type-arguments). We use these declarations to explain the concept:

```
enum SomeEnum {
    SomeEnumVariant<T>(value: T),
    SomeOtherEnumVariant
}
```

To now allow only instances of the [variant][variants] `SomeEnumVariant` with `Int` values, use the following member type:

```
SomeEnum.SomeEnumVariant<Int>
```

### Union Types

If a declaration can have one of multiple types you can denote that with a _union type_:

```
union<String, Int>
```

Here is a breakdown of the syntax:
* The keyword `union`.
* An opening angle bracket.
* A list of types, which are separated by commas. A trailing comma is allowed.
* A closing angle bracket

Note that it is preferable to write the common superclass if this is equivalent to the union type. For example, `Number` has the two subclasses `Int` and `Float`. Therefore, it is usually better to write `Number` as the type rather than `union<Int, Float>`. Use the union type only when you are not able to handle the later addition of further subclasses of `Number` other than `Int` or `Float`.

### Callable Types

A _callable type_ denotes that only values that can be [called][calls] are accepted. This includes:
* [class constructors][class-constructors]
* [constructors of enum variants][enum-variant-constructors]
* [methods][methods]
* [global functions][global-functions]
* [steps][steps]
* [lambdas][lambdas]

Additionally, a callable types specifies the names and types of parameters and results. Here is the most basic callable type that expects neither parameters nor results:

```
() -> ()
```

Let us break down the syntax:
* A pair of parentheses, which is the list of expected [parameters][parameters].
* An arrow `->`.
* A pair of parentheses, which is the list of expected [results][results].

We can now add some expected [parameters][parameters]:

```
(a: Int, b: Int) -> ()
```

These are the syntactic elements:
* [Parameters][parameters] are written in the first pair of parentheses.
* For each [parameter][parameters], specify:
  * Its name.
  * A colon.
  * Its type.
* Separate [parameters][parameters] by commas. A trailing comma is permitted.

Finally, we can add some expected [results][results]:

```
(a: Int, b: Int) -> (r: Int, s: Int)
```

The syntax is reminiscent of the notation for [parameters][parameters]:
* [Results][results] are written in the second pair of parentheses.
* For each [result][results], specify:
  * Its name.
  * A colon.
  * Its type.
* Separate [result][results] by commas. A trailing comma is permitted.

If exactly one result is expected, the surrounding parentheses may be also removed:

```
(a: Int, b: Int) -> r: Int
```

### Parenthesized Types

To improve clarity, parts of a type or the entire type can be enclosed in parentheses. The parentheses have no special meaning and are just meant as a visual guide. Here is an example:

```
(Int)
```

## Corresponding Python Code

**Note:** This section is only relevant if you are interested in the [stub language][stub-language].

Optionally, [type hints][type-hints] can be used in Python to denote the type of a declaration. This is generally advisable, since IDEs can use this information to offer additional feature, like improved refactorings. Moreover, static type checker like [mypy][mypy] can detect misuse of an API without running the code. We will now briefly describe how to best use Python's [type hints][type-hints] and explain how they relate to Simple-ML types.

First, to get [type hints][type-hints] in Python closer to the expected behavior, add the following import to your Python file:

```py
from __future__ import annotations
```

Also add the following import, which brings the declarations that are used by the [type hints][type-hints] into scope. You can remove any declaration you do not need:

```py
from typing import Callable, Optional, Tuple, TypeVar, Union
```

The following table shows how Simple-ML types can be written as Python [type hints][type-hints]:

| Simple-ML Type                         | Python Type Hint                                                   |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Boolean`                              | `bool`                                                             |
| `Float`                                | `float`                                                            |
| `Int`                                  | `int`                                                              |
| `String`                               | `str`                                                              |
| `SomeClass`                            | `SomeClass`                                                        |
| `SomeEnum`                             | `SomeEnum`                                                         |
| `SomeClass?`                           | `Optional[SomeClass]`                                              |
| `SomeEnum?`                            | `Optional[SomeEnum]`                                               |
| `SomeSpecialList<Int>`                 | `SomeSpecialList[int]`                                             |
| `SomeOuterClass.SomeInnerClass`        | `SomeOuterClass.SomeInnerClass`                                    |
| `SomeEnum.SomeEnumVariant`             | `SomeEnum.SomeEnumVariant`                                         |
| `union<String, Int>`                   | `Union[str, int]`                                                  |
| `(a: Int, b: Int) -> r: Int`           | `Callable[[int, int], int]`                                        |
| `(a: Int, b: Int) -> (r: Int, s: Int)` | `Callable[[int, int], Tuple[int, int]]`                            |
| `(SomeClass)`                          | No exact equivalent. Convert the type without parentheses instead. |

Most of these are rather self-explanatory. We will, however, cover the translation of [callable types](#callable-types) in a little more detail: In Python, the type hint for a callable type has the following general syntax:

```
Callable[<list of parameter types>, <result type>]
```

To get the `<list of parameter types>`, simply
1. convert the types of the parameters to their Python syntax,
2. separate them all by commas,
3. surround them by square brackets.

Getting the `<result type`> depends on the number of results. If there is only a single result, simply write down its type. If there are multiple types, do this instead:
1. convert the types of the results to their Python syntax,
2. separate them all by commas,
3. add the prefix `Tuple[`,
4. add the suffix `]`.
