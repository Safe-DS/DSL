The function has no side effects and always returns the same results given the same arguments.

Calls to such a function may be eliminated, if its results are not used. Moreover, the function can be memoized, i.e.
we can remember its results for a set of arguments. Finally, a pure function can be called at any time, allowing
reordering of calls or parallelization.

**Targets:**

- `Function`
