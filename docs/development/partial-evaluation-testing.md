# Partial Evaluation Testing

Partial evaluation tests are data-driven instead of being specified explicitly. This document explains how to add a new
partial evaluation test.

## Adding a partial evaluation test

1. Create a new **folder** (not just a file!) in the `tests/resources/partial evaluation` directory or any subdirectory.
   Give the folder a descriptive name, since the folder name becomes part of the test name.

    !!! tip "Skipping a test"

        If you want to skip a test, add the prefix `skip-` to the folder name.

2. Add files with the extension `.sdstest` **directly inside the folder**. All files in a folder will be loaded into the
   same workspace, so they can reference each other. Files in different folders are loaded into different workspaces, so
   they cannot reference each other.
3. Add the Safe-DS code that you want to test to the files.
4. Surround entire nodes whose value you want to check with test markers, e.g. `1 + 2`.
5. For each pair of test markers, add a test comment with one of the formats listed below. Test comments and test
   markers are mapped to each other by their position in the file, i.e. the first test comment corresponds to the first
   test marker, the second test comment corresponds to the second test marker, etc.
    * `// $TEST$ constant equivalence_class <id>`: Assert that all nodes with the same `<id>` get partially evaluated
      successfully to the same constant expression.
    * `// $TEST$ constant serialization <value>`: Assert that the node gets partially evaluated to a constant expression
      that serializes to `<value>`.
    * `// $TEST$ not constant`: Assert that the node cannot be evaluated to a constant expression.
6. Run the tests. The test runner will automatically pick up the new test.
