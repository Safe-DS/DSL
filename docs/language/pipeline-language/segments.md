# Segments

Segments are used to extract a sequence of [statements][statements] from a data science program to give the sequence a name and make it reusable. In the following discussion we explain how to [declare a segment](#declaring-a-segment) and how to [call it](#calling-a-segment).

## Declaring a Segment

### Minimal Example

Let's look at a minimal example of a segment:

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample() {}
```

This declaration of a segment has the following syntactic elements:

- The keyword `segment`.
- The name of the segment, here `loadMovieRatingsSample`. This can be any combination of upper- and lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers, as long as it does not start with a number. However, we suggest to use `lowerCamelCase` for the names of segments.
- The list of parameters (i.e. inputs) of the segment. This is delimited by parentheses. In the example above, the segment has no parameters.
- The _body_ of the segment, which contains the [statements][statements] that should be run when the segment is [called](#calling-a-segment). The body is delimited by curly braces. In this example, the body is empty, so running this segment does nothing.

### Parameters

To make a segment configurable, add [parameters][parameters] (inputs). We will first show how to [declare parameters](#parameter-declaration) and afterwards how to [refer to them](#references-to-parameters) in the body of the segment.

#### Parameter Declaration

Parameters must be declared in the header of the segment so [callers](#calling-a-segment) know they are expected to pass them as an argument, and so we can [use them](#references-to-parameters) in the body of the segment.

In the following example, we give the segment a single parameters with name `nInstances` and [type][types] `Int`.

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances: Int) {}
```

More information about parameters can be found in the [linked document][parameters].

#### References to Parameters

Within the segment we can access the value of a parameter using a [reference][references]. Here is a basic example where we print the value of the `nInstances` parameter to the console:

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances: Int) {
    print(nInstances);
}
```

More information about references can be found in the [linked document][references].

### Statements

In order to describe what should be done when the segment is executed, we need to add [statements][statements] to its body. The previous example in the section ["References to Parameters"](#references-to-parameters) already contained a statement - an [expression statement][expression-statements] to be precise. Here is another example, this time showing an [assignment][assignments]:

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances: Int) {
    val movieRatingsSample = loadDataset("movieRatings").sample(nInstances = 1000);
}
```

More information about statements can be found in the [linked document][statements]. Note particularly, that all statements must end with a semicolon.

### Results

[Results][results] (outputs) are used to return values that are produced inside the segment back to the caller. First, we show how to [declare the available results](#result-declaration) of the segment and then how to [assign a value to them](#assigning-to-results).

#### Result Declaration

As with [parameters](#parameters) we first need to declare the available results in the headed. This tells [callers](#calling-a-segment) that they can use these results and reminds us to [assign a value to them](#assigning-to-results) in the body of the segment. Let's look at an example:

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances: Int) -> (features: Dataset, target: Dataset) {
    val movieRatingsSample = loadDataset("movieRatings").sample(nInstances = 1000);
}
```

We added two results to the segment: The first one is called `features` and has type `Dataset`, while the second one is called `target` and also has type `Dataset`.

More information about the declaration of results can be found in the [linked document][results].

#### Assigning to Results

Currently, the program will not compile since we never assigned a value to these results. This can be done with an [assignment][assignments] and the `yield` keyword:

```sds
segment loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances: Int) -> (features: Dataset, target: Dataset) {
    val movieRatingsSample = loadDataset("movieRatings").sample(nInstances = 1000);
    yield features = movieRatingsSample.keepAttributes(
        "leadingActor",
        "genre",
        "length"
    );
    yield target = movieRatingsSample.keepAttributes(
        "rating"
    );
}
```

In the assignment beginning with `yield features =` we specify the value of the result called `features`, while the next assignment beginning with `yield target =` assigns a value to the `target` result.

The order of the [result declarations](#result-declaration) does not need to match the order of assignment. However, **each result musts be assigned exactly once**. Note that unlike the `return` in other programming languages, `yield` does not stop the execution of the segment, which allows [assignments][assignments] to different results to be split across multiple [statements][statements].

## Visibility

By default, a segment can be [imported][imports] in any other file and reused there. We say they have `public` visibility. However, it is possible to restrict the visibility of a segment with modifiers:

```sds
internal segment internalSegment() {}

private segment privateSegment() {}
```

The segment `internalSegment` is only visible in files with the same [package][packages]. The segment `privateSegment` is only visible in the file it is declared in.

## Calling a Segment

Inside a [pipeline][pipelines], another segment, or a [lambda][lambdas] we can then [call][calls] a segment, which means the segment is executed when the call is reached: The results of a segment can then be used as needed. In the following example, where we call the segment `loadMovieRatingsSample` that we defined above, we [assign the results to placeholders][assignments-to-placeholders]:

```sds
val features, val target = loadMovieRatingsSample(nInstances = 1000);
```
