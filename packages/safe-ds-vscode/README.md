# Safe-DS

Safely develop Data Science programs with a statically checked domain specific language (DSL) and integrated tools for data
inspection.

![demo](https://github.com/Safe-DS/DSL/raw/main/docs/img/home/demo.gif)

## Installation

To set up a powerful _integrated development environment_ (_IDE_) for Safe-DS, follow these steps:

1. **Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** (VS Code).
2. **Install this extension** for VS Code.

To run Safe-DS programs, you also need the [Safe-DS Runner](https://github.com/Safe-DS/Runner):

1. **Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.11 or 3.12)**. Make sure to add Python to your
   system's `PATH` during installation. Verify installation by running `python --version` in a
   command line. You should get output similar to `Python 3.12.2`.
2. **Open VS Code**.
3. **Open the command palette** (Menu bar > View > Command Palette).
4. **Type `Install the Safe-DS Runner`**.
5. **Press Enter**. Installation may take a few minutes, since it downloads and installs several large libraries
   like PyTorch.
