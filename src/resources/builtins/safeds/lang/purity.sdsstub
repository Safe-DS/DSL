 * Indicates that the function has no side effects and always returns the same results given the same arguments.

 * Calls to such a function may be eliminated, if the result is not used. Moreover, the function can be memoized, i.e.
 * we can remember its results for a set of arguments. Finally, a pure function can be called at any time, allowing
