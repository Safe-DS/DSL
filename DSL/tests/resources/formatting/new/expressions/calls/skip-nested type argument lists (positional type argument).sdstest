     * Once Langium supports LL(*) parsing, this should work.
     *
     * For now, we can either parse
     *     - f<List<S>>() or
     *     - a < f<S>()
     * but not both.
     *
     * The problem is that the parser can't decide with finite lookahead whether
     * the first < is the start of a type argument list or the operator of a
     * comparison expression.
     *
     * We decided to only support the second case for now. The first case leads
     * to a syntax error. To work around this, you can use the following syntax:
     *     - f<T = List<S>>()
     */
    f<List<T>>();
